Installing

Under the menu item "File -> User Preferences -> Add-ons" press the button "Install Add-on from File...", locate the downloaded ui_version_tracker.py.
Activate the functionality by putting a tick in the checkbox of the addon.
Press "Save User Settings" to save the changes.
In case it is not already set, put a tick into the checkbox of "Auto Run Python Scripts" under the File tab.

You will be given a VTracker tab on your tool box.
You have to have your current file saved to turn it into a tracked file.
Tracking the file will create a 001 version and delete the original file.
Pressing Create new version will save your progress into a freshly created file.
Using the drop down menu you may switch between the different versions.
The "Make it head" button will use the current file to create a unique file with the version "head". This is to be used if you want to link data.

As this tool is still in testing please use it cautiosly.
